# GameTheoryTester

I'm taking a Game Theory class, and figured this would be a fun way to 
implement some of the concepts from class and gain a little proficiency with Python.

Current Files:
nasheq: 2 functions: check_nash to check if an action is a Nash Equilibrium, 
    and find_nash to find all Nash Equilibria given a set of action profiles.

strictdominant: 3 functions: is_strictly_dominant and is_strictly_dominant_second to check if individual strategies are strictly dominant, and find_strictly_dominant_strategies to find strictly dominant strategies for 2 users (if they have them).
